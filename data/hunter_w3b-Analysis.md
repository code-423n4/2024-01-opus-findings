## Description overview of The Opus Contest

Opus is to be a platform built on the principles of autonomy and safety, utilizing a `cross-margin` credit protocol. It allows users to borrow against their `portfolios` of curated collateral with minimal human intervention, dynamically determining interest rates, maximum `loan-to-value` ratios, and liquidation `thresholds` based on each user's collateral profile. This suggests that Opus aims to provide a decentralized and efficient system for credit and savings, which aligns with the goals of Cairo as a language designed for cryptographic verification and trustworthiness in executing programs on untrusted machines. Therefore, Cairo could be well-suited for implementing the logic and functionality of `Opus`, ensuring secure and reliable operation.

**The key contracts of Opus protocol for this Audit are**:

- **Shrine**: As the core accounting contract, it is crucial to verify its soundness in tracking collateral and debt over time, enforcing solvency through interest and liquidations, while preventing bugs or exploitation.

- **Purger**: Central to enforcing solvency, its liquidation calculations and permissions must be rigorously analyzed for accuracy and vulnerabilities.

- **Absorber**: Its incentives and controls over participating in liquidations warrant close examination to prevent manipulation.

- **Sentinel**: Playing a major routing role, its permissions and emergency measures require verification.

- **Controller**: With ability to influence the synthetic's stability, its rate adjustments and adaptations need review.

- **Equalizer**: Responsible for maintaining budgets, its surplus allocation and deficit payments are important to analyze.

- **Allocator**: Its recipient definitions and percentage controls over Equalizer could introduce risks if not properly constrained.

A thorough auditing of each contract coupled with focused testing of core functions, permissions, and complex interactions between these integral components is required to establish trust in the structural soundness and economic stability of the Opus protocol.

## System Overview

### Scope

- **abbot.cairo**: The Abbot contract, acting as the interface for users to manage troves, enables sequential opening of troves by depositing and withdrawing collateral tokens, optionally forging and melting synthetics, with ownership rights, restrictions, and cautionary considerations outlined for each operation, allowing users to open new troves, update storage for trove balances and ownership, validate trove ownership before operations.

- **shrine.cairo**: The Shrine contract serves as the core accounting module for a Opus protocol, managing the accounting functions related to collateral (yang) and synthetic tokens (yin), calculating interest, storing yang prices, and implementing the ERC-20 standard for its synthetic. It enforces trove management, tracks yang parameters, and supports operations such as `deposit`, `withdraw`, `forge`, `melt`, `seize`, `redistribute`, inject, eject, and more. The contract incorporates interest rate calculations, a forge fee, liquidation mechanisms, `redistributions`, recovery mode, and an emergency kill switch, with a focus on ensuring the integrity of the accounting system and preventing `unhealthy troves`.

- **absorber.cairo**: The contract implementation of a stability pool, allowing yin holders to contribute funds, participate in liquidations, earn absorption rewards, receive yields, and share additional reward tokens, with specific functions for providing and removing liquidity, tracking absorbed assets and rewards, and an emergency kill function to pause certain operations.Additionally, there are internal functions for handling various aspects such as conversions, assertions, and reward distribution.

- **purger.cairo**: Purger contract is a comprehensive `liquidation` system allowing users to liquidate `unhealthy troves`, either using their own `yin` or the Absorber's yin, with dynamic parameters, penalties, and incentives to ensure the solvency and stability of the protocol. Defines functions for `previewing` and `executing liquidations` and `absorptions of troves`.

- **types.cairo**: This contract defines a set of data structures and associated `serialization` functions for managing protocol, particularly focusing on `trove liquidation`, `yang` redistribution, `absorber` functionality, and various store-related operations, including pricing and validity thresholds.

- **allocator.cairo**: Implements an allocator system with an access control mechanism that manages the allocation of newly minted surplus debt among a dynamic set of recipients, allowing external modification of recipients and their respective percentage shares while ensuring equal array lengths, non-zero recipients, and a total percentage of one Ray.

- **caretaker.cairo**: This contract facilitates the `global shutdown` of the protocol by permanently `disabling` user actions for the `Shrine`, transferring collateral from the Shrine to the `Caretaker`, allowing trove owners to withdraw remaining collateral, and enabling yin holders to burn yin for a proportional share of the collateral, serving as a final system-wide redistribution mechanism after a graceful deprecation.

- **controller.cairo**: Controller contract operates as an `autonomous interest rate` governor, dynamically adjusting a global interest rate multiplier for troves based on the discrepancy between the `spot market price` and the `peg price`, utilizing a Proportional-Integral (`PI`) controller with a nonlinear function to modulate reactions to different error magnitudes, aiming to minimize `peg` error by influencing user behavior in taking on or repaying debt, ultimately stabilizing the `synthetic's` market price.

- **equalizer.cairo**: Maintaining the budget of the Shrine by minting debt surpluses, paying down debt deficits, and distributing income to allocated recipients, with a flexible Allocator module allowing for potential future enhancements in the logic of percentage allocations among recipients. Equalizer with set functionalities, including minting surplus debt, allocating balances based on predefined percentages, and burning yin to offset budget deficits in a Shrine, while incorporating access control and role-based permissions.

- **flash_mint.cairo**: The Flash Mint contract implementing a `flash minting` mechanism that allows users to `borrow` a specified percentage of the total supply of a synthetic token (`Yin`) from the `Shrine contract` for a single transaction, with a fee, and with reentrancy protection to prevent excessive minting loops.

- **gate.cairo**: Serves as an adapter and custodian for collateral tokens in Opus, facilitating the conversion of collateral to and from the yang token in Shrine, with key functions including the transfer of collateral to the Gate through "`enter`" and the transfer of collateral from the Gate through "`exit`," while maintaining a dynamic conversion rate based on the `total yang amount` and Gate's `collateral balance`, and implementing `safeguards` against first depositor `front-running` vulnerabilities.

- **seer.cairo**: seer module serves as an oracle `aggregator` and price updater for multiple assets (`yangs`) within the Opus protocol, `leveraging` various oracles with priorities, a predefined update frequency, and an access control mechanism for roles such as `setting oracles`, `updating frequencies`, and `executing price updates`.

- **sentinel.cairo**: The Sentinel Module serves as an internal router and `gatekeeper` for Gates, streamlining interactions with individual Gates, managing access control, and providing additional functionalities, including `mimicking Gate` functions with collateral token parameters, ensuring proper deployment and initial deposits, enforcing supply caps, and introducing emergency measures like the `kill_gate()` function to halt further deposits while allowing withdrawals.

- **pragma.cairo**: The Purger contract serves as the `primary liquidation mechanism`, allowing users to `liquidate unhealthy troves` either by paying down the trove's debt using their own `yin` with a `liquidation penalty reward` or by absorbing the trove's debt using the Absorber's yin, `redistributing` any remaining debt and compensating the caller, with liquidation penalties and close amounts dynamically determined based on trove health thresholds.

- **roles.cairo**: This contract defines role-based access control constants and functions for various modules within the Opus protocol, specifying specific `permissions` and `roles`, such as `administration`, `liquidation`, `adjustment of parameters`, and `operational control`, for each module.

### Roles

1. **abbot.cairo**

   - **Administrator (Constructor)**: Initializes the contract by setting addresses for external contracts (IShrine and ISentinel), potentially holding a central role in the deployment and configuration of the Abbot contract.

## Approach Taken-in Evaluating The Opus Protocol

Accordingly, I analyzed and audited the subject in the following steps;

1.  **Core Protocol Contract Overview**:

    I focused on thoroughly understanding the codebase and providing recommendations to improve its functionality.
    The main goal was to take a close look at the important contracts and how they work together in the Opus Protocol.

    I start with the following contracts, which play crucial roles in the Opus protocol:

    **Main Contracts I Looked At**

    I start with the following contracts, which play crucial roles in the Opus protocol:

                abbot.cairo
                shrine.cairo
                absorber.cairo
                purger.cairo
                types.cairo
                allocator.cairo
                gate.cairo
                caretaker.cairo

    I started my analysis by examining the intricate structure and functionalities of the `Opus` protocol, which consists of `multiple interoperating` contracts with specialized roles. The core contracts include the `Shrine` for accounting and trove management, `Purger for liquidations`, Absorber for the stability pool, Allocator for distributing surplus, Equalizer for maintaining budgets, and Sentinel for `routing Gates`.

    Together these contracts establish a dynamic `collateral-backed` synthetic token system, with the Shrine tracking collateral deposits and debt, dynamically calculating interest to target a peg, enforcing solvency through `liquidations handled` by the `Purger`. Meanwhile the Absorber acts as an `autonomous liquidity pool`, incentivizing participation. Surplus debt is allocated by the `Equalizer` to recipients defined by the Allocator.

    External components like `Seer` provide price data while Controller adapts interest rates, and Gate contracts enable collateral `entry/exit`. Strict access controls and roles ensure integrity, with liquidations, adjustments, pricing all permissioned. This sophisticated yet modular design establishes a robust, autonomous, and highly configurable decentralized stablecoin protocol.

    However, factors like complex interactions, differentiated permissions, off-chain configurations, and the critical nature of core accounting functions make the overall system complex and introduce potential risks around failures, manipulation, and unintended impacts that would require careful auditing and testing to identify and mitigate.

2.  **Documentation Review**:

    Then went to Review [This Docs](https://demo-35.gitbook.io/untitled/) for a more detailed and technical explanation of Opus protocol.

3.  **Compiling code and running provided tests**:

4.  **Manuel Code Review** In this phase, I initially conducted a line-by-line analysis, following that, I engaged in a comparison mode.

    - **Line by Line Analysis**: Pay close attention to the contract's intended functionality and compare it with its actual behavior on a line-by-line basis.

    - **Comparison Mode**: Compare the implementation of each function with established standards or existing implementations, focusing on the function names to identify any deviations.

## Codebase Quality

The `Opus` protocol employs Cairo, a programming language tailored for cryptographic scenarios, to efficiently prove program execution on untrusted machines. Specifically designed for `Starknet`, a `Layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution`, Cairo enables a single prover node to execute programs, generating proofs for verification on an Ethereum smart contract. Cairo's unique features include its non-deterministic approach for faster verification, and an immutable memory model, requiring careful memory management for optimal performance. These characteristics distinguish Cairo as a fitting choice for addressing cryptographic and efficiency needs within the Opus protocol in the blockchain domain.

Overall, I consider the quality of the `Opus` protocol codebase to be Good. The code appears to be mature and well-developed. We have noticed the implementation of various standards adhere to appropriately. Details are explained below:

| Codebase Quality Categories              | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Code Maintainability and Reliability** | The Opus Protocol contracts demonstrates good maintainability through modular structure, consistent naming, and efficient use of libraries(`wadray`). It also prioritizes reliability by handling errors, conducting security checks. However, for enhanced reliability, consider professional security audits and documentation improvements. Regular updates are crucial in the evolving space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Code Comments**                        | During the audit of the `Opus` contracts codebase, I found that some areas lacked sufficient internal documentation to enable independent comprehension. While comments provided high-level context for certain constructs, lower-level logic flows and variables were not fully explained within the code itself. Following best practices like NatSpec could strengthen self-documentation. As an auditor without additional context, it was challenging to analyze code. To further understand implementation intent for those complex parts, referencing more supplemental documentation was necessary. Some constants and parameters in the contract seem arbitrary and lack explanations. Arbitrary values might affect the system's stability and should be carefully chosen and documented. |
| **Documentation**                        | The documentation of the Opus project is quite comprehensive and detailed, providing a solid overview of how `Opus` protocol is structured and how its various aspects function and good explanation of each module and it's intreaction with other module.`Diagrams` make very good to gain a deeper understanding of how different module interact and the functions they implement. With considerable enthusiasm. We are confident that these diagrams will bring significant value to the protocol as they can be seamlessly integrated into the existing documentation, enriching it and providing a more comprehensive and detailed understanding for users, developers.                                                                                                                      |
| **Testing**                              | The audit scope of the contracts to be audited is 90% this is Good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Code Structure and Formatting**        | The codebase contracts are well-structured and formatted when analyzing the code structure and formatting of the Opus protocol overall, I evaluate the organization of modules, the clarity of function and variable names, the consistency in coding style, the presence of documentation, adherence to coding standards, and the overall readability and maintainability of the codebase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Systemic & Centralization Risks

The analysis provided highlights several significant systemic and centralization risks present in the Opus protocol. These risks encompass concentration risk in abbot, shrine.cario risk and more, third-party dependency risk, and centralization risks arising.

Here's an analysis of potential systemic and centralization risks in the contracts:

### Systemic Risks:

1. **abbot.cairo**

   - **Indexing Troves**: The contract uses the total troves count as an index for new troves. If there are issues with the counting mechanism, it could lead to troves being assigned incorrect IDs, introducing systemic inconsistencies.

   - **Sequential Trove IDs**: If the issuance of trove IDs in a sequential manner becomes a bottleneck, potentially leading to congestion or unfair access to trove creation.

2. **shrine.cairo**

   - **Liquidity Risks**: Insufficient liquidity in the system, especially during times of high volatility or stress, may result in trove liquidations that could trigger a cascade of events affecting the entire system.

   - **Recovery Mode**: The activation of recovery mode and the gradual adjustment of thresholds might introduce systemic risks if not carefully managed. Sudden adjustments in trove thresholds could trigger unintended liquidations, impacting the overall health of the system.

   - Large debt ceiling allows high `leverage` risk of cascading liquidations in a crash.

   - Priority of redistribution over liquidation is risky

   - No circuit breakers, users can deposit risky assets with high volatality

3. **absorber.cairo**

   - **Atomic Removal and Front-Running**: The removal mechanism introduces a `timelock` to prevent risk-free `yield-farming` tactics. However, there might be scenarios where providers can strategically front-run liquidations by exploiting the removal mechanism during timelock intervals.

   - **Epoch Transition Vulnerability**: In rare cases where the epoch changes, conversion rates and shares may be affected, leading to potential inconsistencies in calculations and resulting in undesired outcomes.

4. **allocator.cairo**

   - **Storage Operations**: The contract uses LegacyMap for storage, and any issues in storage operations, such as reading/writing values or managing indices, could result in incorrect allocation or data corruption.

5. **caretaker.cairo**

   - **Permanent Loss of Income for Allocated Recipients**: In case there are troves with unaccrued interest at the time of shutdown, the exclusion of unaccrued interest from the total troves' debt may result in a permanent loss of income for allocated recipients. This occurs because debt surpluses via the Equalizer, intended for allocated recipients, may not be minted due to the design choice not to charge interest on all troves.

6. **controller.cairo**

   - **Price Manipulation or Market Manipulation**: The autonomous adjustment of the interest rate multiplier based on market price deviation introduces the risk of potential market manipulation. Malicious actors may attempt to exploit the controller's reactions to create artificial deviations and benefit from the resulting changes in interest rates.

7. **equalizer.cairo**

   - **Budget Manipulation Vulnerability**: The equalize function may create a vulnerability if the `budget` is not consistently maintained or if the debt ceiling adjustment logic has unforeseen issues. This could potentially lead to unintended budget surpluses or deficits.

   - **Debt Ceiling Adjustment Complexity**: The need to temporarily raise the debt ceiling during surplus minting introduces complexity, and any oversight in the implementation may result in unintended consequences, such as inflation or issues related to debt repayment.

8. **flash_mint.cairo**

   - **Flash Minting Amount Calculation**: The flash mint amount is calculated as a percentage of the circulating Yin supply, and if this calculation is inaccurate or manipulated, it might lead to unexpected systemic consequences

9. **seer.cairo**

   - **Fallback Mechanism**: In the case of a missing price update (when no oracle successfully fetches a price), the contract emits a `PriceUpdateMissed` event but continues execution. Depending on the severity, this might expose the system to unintended consequences if not handled appropriately.

   - **Fetch Price Exception Handling**: The contract mentions a TODO comment regarding wrapping `fetch_price` in a `try-catch` block when possible in Cairo. Without proper exception handling, a failure in fetching prices from one oracle could potentially interrupt the entire price update process.

10. **sentinel.cairo**

    - **Protocol Balance Cap**: The enter function reverts if the amount of collateral tokens deposited will raise the protocol's balance above the cap for that yang. However, if the cap is not appropriately set or if there are unforeseen circumstances, it could lead to potential systemic risks.

    - **Gate Suspension Risk**: The contract has mechanisms (`suspend_yang and unsuspend_yang`) to suspend or unsuspend a yang, potentially affecting the overall system. Misuse of these mechanisms or failure to reactivate a yang could pose risks.

11. **pragma.cairo**

    - **Market Liquidity Risks**: The contract assumes that sufficient liquidity exists for trove liquidations, but sudden market fluctuations or illiquidity could hinder the ability to execute liquidations effectively, leading to potential losses for users or impacting the protocol's solvency.

    - **Data Feed Denomination Mismatch**: The contract assumes that the data feed from the Oracle is denominated in the same asset as the synthetic in Shrine. If there is a mismatch, especially when the synth is denominated in a currency other than USD and there's no feed for it, the contract might not function correctly.

    - **Oracle Timestamp Synchronization**: The contract relies on the synchronization of timestamps between the blockchain and the Oracle. Inconsistencies or delays in timestamp synchronization might impact the validity of price updates.

### Centralization Risks:

1. **abbot.cairo**

   - **Ownership Concentration**: The concept of trove ownership implies that a single entity (the trove owner) has control over certain functions, potentially leading to centralization if a small number of entities dominate the ownership distribution.

2. **shrine.cairo**

   - **Forge Function Control**: If the forge function (debt creation) is not adequately controlled or subject to centralized influence, it may lead to unbalanced minting of synthetic assets, affecting the stability of the system.

   - **Budget Adjustments**: Centralized control over budget adjustments, especially if not subject to governance mechanisms, may introduce centralization risks. Unilateral control over the budget could impact the economic stability and fairness of the protocol.

   - **System Shutdown**: The ability to permanently kill the `Shrine` contract using `Shrine.kill` introduces a centralization risk if the decision and execution rest solely in the hands of a `centralized` authority.

   - Debt ceiling changes by single owner address

   - Yang prices determined by single off-chain oracle introduces risks of manipulation

3. **absorber.cairo**

   - **Role-Based Access Control**: The contract uses `role-based` access control, allowing specific roles to execute `critical` functions. Centralization risks arise if the assignment and management of these roles are not decentralized, potentially leading to control concentration.

   - **Single Point of Failure**: The contract has a kill function that irreversibly pauses key operations. If the `Absorber's` kill function is controlled by a single entity or limited group, it introduces a single point of failure and centralization risk.

4. **allocator.cairo**

   - **Single Allocator**: The contract appears to represent a single allocator for managing surplus debt allocation. If this contract is the sole allocator in the system, it could lead to centralization of the allocation process. A more decentralized architecture with multiple allocators might mitigate this risk.

5. **equalizer.cairo**

   - **Fixed Allocator Implementation**: The initial implementation of the `Allocator` module being a simple contract with fixed allocated percentages may lead to centralization if it lacks flexibility or autonomy in adjusting percentages dynamically.

6. **flash_mint.cairo**

   - **Governance Dependency**: The ability to `adjust the maximum borrowing percentage` through contract redeployment introduces centralization risk, especially if controlled by a single entity or governed by a centralized authority.

7. **seer.cairo**

   - **Oracle Priority**: The oracles are stored in a `map` with priorities, and their order is determined by the `index`. The centralization risk lies in the `fixed order of oracles`, potentially favoring certain oracles over others. If one oracle is given undue priority, it may introduce centralization risks and vulnerabilities.

8. **sentinel.cairo**

   - **Gate Management**: The Sentinel acts as a `gatekeeper` for Gates, and its central role in `routing actions` and managing access control introduces centralization risks, especially if compromised.

   - **Emergency Mechanisms**: The `kill_gate()` function, serving as an emergency mechanism, may introduce centralization concerns if misused.

9. **pragma.cairo**

   - **Limited Sources for Price Aggregation**: The contract sets `bounds` on the minimum and maximum number of data publishers used to `aggregate price values`. If the number of approved sources is limited and controlled by a small set of entities, it introduces centralization risks in the price discovery process.

   - **Single Data Feed Denomination Assumption**: The contract assumes that data feeds are `typically` in USD. This assumption might introduce centralization risks if the ecosystem relies on a specific denomination, and any changes in that denomination might not be handled seamlessly.

**Properly managing these risks and implementing best practices in security and decentralization will contribute to the sustainability and long-term success of the Opus protocol.**

## Conclusion

In general, The `Opus` protocol presents a well-designed architecture. The Opus protocol exhibits strengths comprehensive testing, and detailed documentation, we believe the team has done a good job regarding the code. However, there are areas for improvement, including governance features, profit distribution optimization, and code documentation. Systemic risks include initial governance role assignment, while centralization risks involve certain contracts and functions. Recommendations include enhancing governance features, optimizing profit distribution, improving documentation, addressing systemic risks, and mitigating centralization risks. It is also highly recommended that the team continues to invest in security measures such as mitigation reviews, audits, and bug bounty programs to maintain the security and reliability of the project.
