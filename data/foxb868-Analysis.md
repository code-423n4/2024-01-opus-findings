## Admin Abuse Risks

While roles are appropriately segregated, centralized control remains a core vulnerability. Two refinements can shift governance to community-coordinated autonomy:

1. **Implement a decentralized admin model** 
   - Core parameters changes require multi-sig approvals from diverse stakeholders 
   - Build an on-chain admin collective coordinated via token weighted voting

2. **Enact adaptive constraints around critical operations**
   - Programmatically restrict pace and scope of changes based on current volatility 
   - Algorithmically define safe ranges and step increments for tuning risk parameters  
   
Both solutions democratize control while limiting pace/scale of mutations to avoid parameter cliff effects. The system can evolve rapidly within predefined safe bands but fundamental changes require gradually accrued consensus.

**Access control**

1. Access to the Seer, Sentinel, and Gate modules:

- All three modules utilize the shared access control component to restrict access. 

- The Sentinel and Gate only allow the Shrine to call their external functions.

- The Seer requires specific roles to invoke privileged functions.

So external access looks properly restricted.

2. Admin privilege restrictions:

- Admin roles are split into discrete privileges based on function groupings.

- The Shrine in particular has granular roles defined.

- No single role seems to grant excessive capabilities.

However, a few things that could be improved:

- There are broad `default_admin_role` functions defined that grant elevated privileges. These could be split out into more granular subsets.

- No multi-sig or time delays are implemented on sensitive privilege escalations. 

- The ability to revoke elevated privileges is not shown.

The access control model provides a good foundation. But some enhancements like multi-sig admin, privilege expirations, and revocation capabilities would help further restrict and audit admin access.

**[Abbot module code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus/blob/main/src/core/abbot.cairo)**

1. On trove ID issuance:

- Trove IDs are issued sequentially based on a `troves_count` variable that monotonically increments.  

- Mapping from user address and index to trove ID seems robust.

- No way found for gaps in IDs or double issuing.

So trove ID sequencing appears consistent and gap-free.

2. On validating trove creation:

- The `open_trove` function checks that collateral is non-zero on opening.

- Debt ceilings in the Shrine module restrict maximum debt amounts.

- The `assert_valid_trove_action` call checks LTV ratio before debt increase.

- Deposits go through the Sentinel which does cap checking.

So there are checks in place during open and deposits to restrict manipulation.

**However, potential issues:**

- No validation happens on the initial collateral ratios.

- Oracle price discrepancies could still allow LTV manipulation.

So some additional hardening would be ideal, like:

- Minimum collateralization ratios on open based on risk parameters.

- Use of TWAP prices instead of spot to reduce manipulation vectors.

But overall the key validation points are there.

**Based on reviewing the Allocator module code, my assessment of the debt surplus distribution risks**

1. Manipulation of debt surplus calculations:

- The `set_allocation` function requires admin access and enforces key consistency checks on the percentages - they must add up to 100%. 

- There don't appear to be ways for non-admins to influence the calculations.

- The actual distribution happens in the Equalizer based on the Allocator outputs.

So direct manipulation should not be possible.

2. Errors and inconsistencies in percentages:

- The percentages are stored and summed as Rays which have 27 decimal precision, minimizing rounding errors.

- The totals are asserted to equal one Ray exactly to avoid issues. 

- And the Equalizer divides the debt evenly based on the percentages.

So rounding or summing inconsistencies seem unlikely.

However, a few potential issues:

- No validation occurs that receiver addresses are valid. An error here could cause loss of funds.

- Large number of recipients could increase rounding errors. Capping totals may be prudent.

The system appears designed to minimize inconsistencies. But further protecting against invalid receivers and limiting totals would provide defense-in-depth.

**My assessment of potential issues with [Caretaker contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus/blob/main/src/core/caretaker.cairo)**

1. Risk of denied collateral claims:

- The `release` function returns all collateral to the trove owner after system shutdown.

- Caretaker tracks total yin to back for claiming transparently. 

- The yin `reclaim` process burns yin and transfers proportional collateral share.

So collateral release and claiming seems accounted for properly during deprecation.

2. Security risks in yin reclaim process: 

- No checks exist for sudden contract balance drops before transfers.

- Asset transfer calls don't check return values for failure.

- Rounding without remainders could allow tiny exploitation over time.

- No logic restricts multiple reclaims per user.

So there is room for improvement in security hardening during the yin to collateral conversion process:

- Check for unreasonable contract balance decreases
- Check return values on transfers  
- Add remainder tracking to roundings
- Limit number of claims per user

Adding the above would help reduce potential attack surfaces when winding down.


**My assessment of the potential issues with the [Controller](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus/blob/main/src/core/controller.cairo) module**

1. Exploiting interest rate adjustments:

- The multiplier is controlled via a standard PID controller. This makes it harder to induce instability.

- Reasonable constraints are set on multiplier bounds, alpha, and beta terms.

- Integral and proportional components use non-linear transforms to limit effects.

So the basic mechanism seems designed well for stability.

However, some vectors may still exist:

- Very high P/I gains combined with max alpha/beta multipliers could likely still destabilize.

- No check exists for upholding minimum stable time between adjustments.

- Could trigger rapid changes via price manipulation.


2. Bounds on multiplier:

- A maximum 10x upper bound is enforced on the multiplier.

- The lower bound is set at 0.2x. 

These seem like reasonable constraints. Though the impacts at 10x interest rates may need to be evaluated for risks.

The core mechanism is solid but further protections could help:

- Stricter constraints on tunable model parameters.

- Limiting frequency of changes as a secondary defense.

- Tighter bounds on the multiplier values allowed.

This would help provide defense-in-depth against instability exploits.

**My assessment of the potential issues with the [Equalizer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus/blob/main/src/core/equalizer.cairo) module**

1. Risks from debt manipulation:

- Minting and allocating surplus debt helps balance system budget. 

- Burning debt directly from users can cover deficits.

- Could incentivize malicious activity to profit from forced debt dilutions.

- No checks exist for whether total debt still tracks trove debt.

So debt manipulation carries risks if not monitored carefully.


2. Budget imbalance edge cases:

- Interest accumulation errors could leave minor deficits.

- Excessive liquidations may cut debt without proportional cut in collateral. 

- Imprecision in redistributions could strand debt without backing.

So small budget imbalances could emerge gradually without active balancing.

Some ways the risks could be mitigated:

- More precisely track debt offsets from liquidations and dilutions.

- Actively rebalance collateralization ratios when thresholds are breached.

- Implement better protections around redistributions stranding debt.

Enhanced precision on debt tracking and more active rebalancing would help minimize edge case risks that could emerge over time.

**My assessment of the potential issues in the [Purger](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus/blob/main/src/core/purger.cairo) module**

1. Accuracy of unhealthy trove identification:

- The `get_trove_health` call incorporates the collateral value, debt, and thresholds.

- This accounts for custom threshholds set per collateral type.

- Debt is dynamically compounding interest rates.

So it seems designed to adapt to complex collateral types and accurately assess trove health.

2. Risk of unfair/incorrect liquidations:

- Liquidations cut debt first before collateral to minimize losses.

- Redistribution mechanisms consider isolating exceptional collateral.

- Compensation rewards liquidators but has a maximum percentage.

So there seems to be an attempt at balancing fairness and incentives.

However, some risks remain:

- Collateral value relies on potentially manipulable price oracles. 

- Compounded debt could deviate from actual debt owed due to rounding errors.

- Liquidation delays may allow troves to re-enter safe ratios.

So while the high level logic accounts for complexity, a few areas merit hardening to improve accuracy and user protection.

**My assessment of the potential issues in the [Sentinel](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus/blob/main/src/core/sentinel.cairo) module**

1. Unauthorized access to collateral:

- The Sentinel acts as the authorized caller into Gates. 

- Strict access control isn't shown for the Sentinel itself.

- Admin roles seem broad in scope.

So increased protections on the Sentinel would be prudent.

2. Security of inter-module interactions: 

- State changes in Gates and Shrine rely on Sentinel calls.

- No validation is done on return values from proxy contract calls.

- No protections against reentrancy are mentioned.

So there may be inconsistencies if external callbacks failed or were manipulated.

Some ways to improve Sentinel security:

- Lock down roles and permissions to necessity.  

- Check return values on cross-contract calls.

- Implement reentrancy guards when interfacing with other modules.

- Use interface abstractions between modules to limit access.

The Sentinel holds a lot of privilege in the ecosystem. Hardening its permissions, validating external interactions,  and isolating integration points would reduce attack surface area.

## Systemic Risks

The high collateralization ratios guard against isolated shocks. However, fragility to cascading liquidity crises remains. A lender of last resort backstop fortifies durability:  

- Reserve pooling contract automatically mints stabilizing tokens during market contractions
- Redeemable by participants using locked collateral from expired liquidated troves
- Buffers against panic-induced insolvency without reliance on speculative arbs for reserves 

The autonomous countercyclical support smoothens discontinuities from economic Coasean dynamics.

**Technical Risks**

Contracts are well architected but remain vulnerable to incremental drifts across trust boundaries. Rigorous invariant tracking enhances consistency:

- Build early warning monitors for technical margin erosion like collateralization ratios
- Prevent operations if reconciliations deviate past risk thresholds 
- Gracefully pause functionality when critical indicators are violated

Continuous telemetry around margins of safety crucially bolsters the fidelity of calculated financial states. 

**Integration Risks**

Centralized bridges bloat failure domains and socialize losses. Interchain support should decentralize:  

- Generalized lending against cross chain NFTs/tokens minimizes need for custodial asset mirroring
- Relays enable non-custodial message passing to honor cross domain loan commits and repayments

These solutions enhance reliability and censorship resistance for the multi-chain future.
