## 1. Overview
Opus is like a special system that lets you borrow money using assets you already own. These assets are chosen carefully and sometimes make money on their own. With Opus, there's not much need for people to get involved because the system figures out things like how much interest you'll pay, how much you can borrow compared to the value of your assets, and when your assets might be sold if needed. It's like having a smart system that helps you get money when you need it, using the stuff you already own, without a lot of hassle.

## 3. Modules Breif Overview

- Abbot
    - Abbot serves as a gateway for users to interact with the shrine module. As the primary entry point, Abbot assumes the pivotal role of managing both `users`  and their corresponding `troves` . It maintains meticulous records of user activities and trove statuses, ensuring transparency and efficiency throughout operations. Through Abbot's interface, users can initiate various actions, including the creation and closure of troves. Moreover, Abbot allows users to deposit and withdraw yang assets into and from troves, fostering liquidity and flexibility within the system. Additionally, it facilitates the forging and melting of debt associated with yin synthetics, enabling users to navigate and optimize their financial positions effectively.
- Sentinel
    - Sentinel plays a crucial role as a guardian at the gate module, which serves as the secure storage for all assets. It also monitors yang assets and their associated gate modules, ensuring that everything remains in order. Sentinel holds the exclusive privilege of accessing the gate module, acting as the sole authority in this regard. Additionally, Sentinel undertakes the essential task of adding approved yang assets to the shrine through a process known as yang addition. Moreover, it actively participates in the management of yang assets by facilitating the suspension and resumption of their usage as needed, thereby maintaining control and stability within the system.
- Gate
    - The Gate module serves as the primary repository for all deposited yang, functioning as the reserve for assets within the system. Its core responsibility lies in managing the calculation and transfer of assets, both incoming and outgoing, under the command of Sentinel. Gate acts as the intermediary through which assets flow in and out of the system, ensuring smooth and secure transactions facilitated by Sentinel's directives.
- Flash Mint
    - Flash Mint serves as a flashloan lender. It adheres to the standards outlined in the EIP-3156 specification for flash lender contracts, ensuring compatibility and interoperability across platforms. Presently, Flash Mint exclusively supports shrine's synthetic `yin`  for flash loans, providing users with access to temporary liquidity against their assets.
- Shrine
    
    The Shrine module serves as the central accounting system for a synthetic yin within the ecosystem. End users do not have direct interaction with Shrine; rather, only specific access-holding modules can engage with it. Shrine is responsible for various critical functions:
    
    1. **Trove Management**: It maintains the trove positions of users, including yang deposits and trove debts.
    2. **Interest Calculation**: Shrine calculates and charges interest for each trove debt, ensuring proper accounting and debt management.
    3. **Price Storage**: It stores the prices of yang assets, providing crucial market data for asset valuation and management.
    4. **Multiplier Value Storage**: Shrine retains the multiplier value obtained from the Controller module, which influences various aspects of the system's operation.
    5. **Debt Issuance**: It is responsible for issuing debt by minting yin synthetic tokens to users and collecting interest on these debts, facilitating the creation and management of debt instruments within the system.
    
    Overall, Shrine acts as the backbone of the accounting infrastructure for synthetic yin, playing a pivotal role in maintaining financial stability and facilitating efficient operations within the ecosystem.
    
- Seer
    - Seer serves as the module responsible for managing and maintaining oracles within the system. Its primary function involves holding and overseeing the oracles, which are essential for providing accurate market data. Seer ensures that the values of yang assets are regularly updated based on current market prices, enhancing transparency and reliability within the ecosystem. Moreover, Seer maintains a priority list of oracles, which serves as a backup in case a primary oracle fails to deliver the required price data. The module operates on a predetermined update frequency, ensuring that price updates occur at specified intervals. Additionally, Seer facilitates force updates of prices when necessary, enabling timely adjustments and ensuring the accuracy of asset valuations.
- Equalizer
    - The Equalizer plays a critical role in maintaining the budget equilibrium of the Shrine. It achieves this by periodically resetting the budget to zero through two primary mechanisms: minting debt surpluses and paying down debt deficits. When there is a surplus in debt, the Equalizer mints new debt to bring the budget back to equilibrium. Conversely, when there is a deficit in debt, it pays down the debt to restore balance. By effectively managing these processes, the Equalizer ensures that the Shrine's budget remains stable and aligned with its financial objectives.Another important function that the Equalizer performs is the distribution of income to allocated recipients. When debt surpluses are minted, the `yin` is minted to the Equalizer's address
- Caretaker
    - The Caretaker assumes the responsibility of closing the Shrine module, which serves as the core component of protocol accounting. Upon the shutdown of the Shrine, all assets are transferred to the Caretaker's custody. Here, users have the opportunity to claim assets backed by their trove positions. This pivotal role ensures the orderly management of assets and facilitates user access to their rightful holdings following the closure of the Shrine module
- Allocator
    - The Allocator module collaborates with the Equalizer module to distribute its yin balance among designated recipients. It maintains a record of recipients and their respective share percentages of the Equalizer balance. Through this mechanism, the Allocator ensures that the yin balance is allocated efficiently and in accordance with predefined distribution criteria established by the Equalizer module.

## 4. Recommendation

After the completion of this audit we have some thoughts and recommendations for the Opus protocol team to implement.

##### 1. Yang management model.
At present, Sentinel largely oversees the management of yang assets. However, once a yang asset is terminated, there's no provision for redeploying or establishing another gate for the same yang asset in the future. While this might be intentional in the current design, it could be beneficial to introduce flexibility in the system, allowing for the deployment or replacement of yang assets as needed. This flexibility would enable users to adapt to changing circumstances and optimize their asset management strategies over time. Introducing such flexibility could enhance the overall usability and versatility of the system, empowering users to make more informed decisions regarding their yang assets.

##### 2. The Allocator contract is might behave odd with duplicate allocators:
The implementation of the allocation module indicates that the total percentage should sum up to RAY. However, this requirement can be compromised if duplicate recipients are incorrectly passed. Such a situation may lead to either the obstruction of equalizer asset distribution or the distribution of a lower amount than intended. To ensure the correct distribution of assets and prevent discrepancies, it's crucial to validate recipient data to avoid duplicates and ensure that the total percentage aligns with the expected RAY value. Implementing robust validation mechanisms and error handling procedures can help maintain the integrity of the allocation process and prevent potential issues related to incorrect recipient data.
