# Audit approach

1.  Read the README.md
    
2.  Try to understand how the system works
    
3.  Look at the  <ins>Opus</ins>  repo to get a better idea of the protocol.
    
4.  Look at each code individually and focus on the internal function calls.
    
5.  Write a Report by compiling all the insights I gained throughout the line-by-line code review.
    

# suggestion for judges

suggestion for judges would be to focus on the following key aspects when evaluating the smart contract implementations:

1.  Security Measures: Assess the presence of reentrancy guards, access control mechanisms, and other safety features to ensure the contracts are secure against potential vulnerabilities.
    
2.  Functionality: Evaluate the completeness and correctness of functions related to trove management, asset handling, debt management, and other financial operations.
    
3.  Code Structure: Consider the clarity and organization of the code, including comments, event definitions, and modular design for better readability and maintainability.
    
4.  Compliance: Check if the contracts adhere to relevant standards such as ERC-20, ERC-3156, and any other specified requirements.
    
5.  Efficiency: Look for optimized calculations, minimal gas usage, and effective resource management within the contracts.
    

# Contracts in the Scope:

\# src/core/abbot.cairo

The contract handles operations related to providing, removing, and reaping assets, as well as managing rewards and epochs. It also includes internal helper functions for accounting, updating, and transferring assets.

\# src/core/allocator.cairo

It defines an "Allocator" module with components, constants, storage structures, events, a constructor, external allocator functions, internal allocator functions, and helper functions. The contract manages the allocation of assets to recipients based on specified percentages and handles related access control.

\# src/core/caretaker.cairo

It defines an "Allocator" module with components, constants, storage structures, events, a constructor, external allocator functions, internal allocator functions, and helper functions. The contract manages the allocation of assets to recipients based on specified percentages and handles related access control.

\# src/core/controller.cairo

It includes components, constants, storage structures, events, a constructor, and various functions for updating and retrieving parameters related to a controller. The code seems to be focused on managing multipliers and integral terms for a financial system. It also contains pure functions for nonlinear transformation and bound checking.

\# src/core/equalizer.cairo

It includes components, storage, events, a constructor, and external functions for an "Equalizer" contract. The contract seems to handle the minting and allocation of surplus debt, as well as the normalization of budget deficits. The code also includes various access control and event handling mechanisms.

\# src/core/flash\_mint.cairo

It includes a flash minting module that implements the ERC-3156 flash loan standard. The code defines storage structures, events, and functions related to flash minting, including view and external functions for flash loans. It also handles reentrancy and debt ceiling adjustments. Overall, it seems to be a well-structured and comprehensive implementation of flash minting functionality within a smart contract.

\# src/core/gate.cairo

It defines a contract called "gate" that interacts with ERC-20 assets and implements various functions for entering and exiting the contract. The contract also includes event definitions, a constructor, and internal helper functions for converting between asset and yang amounts. The code is structured and well-commented, making it clear and understandable.

\# src/core/purger.cairo

It defines a purger module that includes various components, constants, storage structures, events, a constructor, and both view and external functions. The module seems to be related to managing trove liquidations and absorptions within a financial system.

The code includes implementations for functions such as preview\_liquidate, preview\_absorb, is\_absorbable, get\_penalty\_scalar, set\_penalty\_scalar, liquidate, and absorb. These functions handle operations related to trove liquidations, absorptions, and penalty management.

Additionally, the code contains internal helper functions for calculating penalties, maximum close amounts, and percentage of collateral freed. It also includes pure functions for specific calculations related to liquidations and absorptions.

The code is heavily commented, which is helpful for understanding the logic and purpose of each function and component.

\# src/core/seer.cairo

It defines a "Seer" module that interacts with other components such as access control, oracles, shrine, and sentinel. The module includes storage, events, a constructor, external and internal functions, and interfaces. It seems to be focused on updating prices and managing oracles for various assets. The code also includes comments and event definitions for price updates, frequency changes, and other relevant actions.

\# src/core/sentinel.cairo

It defines a contract called "sentinel" that includes various components, constants, storage structures, events, a constructor, external functions, internal functions, and helper functions.

The contract manages the addition, suspension, and removal of "yangs" and their associated "gates" within a "shrine." It also includes functions for converting assets to yangs and vice versa, as well as entering and exiting operations.

The code uses the StarkNet-specific syntax and features, such as storage annotations, event declarations, and access control assertions. It also leverages the starknet and opus namespaces for interacting with the StarkNet platform and other contracts.

\# src/core/shrine.cairo

The contract seems to be a shrine component with various functionalities related to managing yangs, troves, debt, interest rates, and other financial operations. It also includes event definitions, a constructor, external functions for interacting with the shrine, and core functions for depositing, withdrawing, forging, and other operations.

\# src/external/pragma.cairo

It includes components, constants, storage, events, a constructor, external functions, and internal functions. The smart contract interacts with an oracle to fetch and validate price data. It also includes access control and emits events for various actions.

\# src/types.cairo

It includes various data structures, enums, and implementations for packing and unpacking data into and from specific formats. The code also defines constants and includes some pragma-related modules.

\# src/core/roles.cairo

consists of several modules, each containing constants and functions related to specific roles. These roles are represented as u128 values and are associated with various administrative actions. Each module contains a default\_admin\_role function that returns the combined value of certain constants, representing the default administrative role for that module. Additionally, some modules contain other functions related to specific actions or roles.

# Security Approach of the Project

- **Minimize Complexity**: Keep the smart contract logic as simple as possible to reduce the attack surface. Complex systems are more prone to bugs and vulnerabilities.
    
- **Separation of Concerns**: Divide the contract's functionalities into smaller, modular components. This can help isolate vulnerabilities and make the contract easier to audit.
    
- **Secure Coding Guidelines**: Enforce secure coding practices among developers. Follow best practices for Solidity development to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.
    

Remember that security is an ongoing process, and regular reviews, updates, and improvements are essential to stay ahead of emerging threats. Collaborating with experienced blockchain security professionals and conducting frequent security assessments can significantly enhance the security posture of the project.
