## Mechanism Review
Based on modules within the Opus protocol:

**Shrine Module:**
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus/blob/main/src/core/shrine.cairo#L2
   - Mechanism: Collateralization and issuance of yin tokens against collateral tokens.
   - Review: The Shrine module serves as the core of the Opus protocol, facilitating the creation of yin tokens backed by collateral. It ensures the stability and integrity of the system by managing collateralization ratios and issuing yin tokens in a controlled manner.

**Abbot Module:**
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus/blob/main/src/core/abbot.cairo#L2
   - Mechanism:
The Abbot module serves as the primary user interface for managing troves within the Shrine. It enables users to interact with the protocol to open, close, deposit, withdraw, forge, and melt troves.
   - Review:
User-Friendly Interface: The Abbot module provides a straightforward and intuitive interface for users to manage their troves. This enhances user experience and accessibility.
Sequential Trove ID Generation: Enforcing sequential trove ID generation simplifies trove management and tracking for users and the protocol.
Comprehensive Trove Management: Users can perform all necessary trove operations, including opening, closing, depositing, withdrawing, forging, and melting, through a single interface.
 
**Sentinel Module:**
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus/blob/main/src/core/sentinel.cairo
   - Mechanism: Internal router and gatekeeper for Gates.
   - Review: The Sentinel module serves as the internal interface for interacting with Gate modules, abstracting away the need for direct interaction with individual Gate addresses. It enhances security and simplifies access control between different modules within the protocol.

**Gate Module:**
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus/blob/main/src/core/gate.cairo#L2
   - Mechanism: Adapter and custodian for collateral tokens.
   - Review: The Gate module acts as an adapter and custodian for collateral tokens, enabling users to deposit collateral into troves and receive yang tokens in return. It ensures seamless interaction with collateral tokens while maintaining the integrity of the protocol.

**Purger Module:**
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus/blob/main/src/core/purger.cairo#L2
   - Mechanism: Liquidator of unhealthy troves.
   - Review: The Purger module plays a critical role in maintaining the solvency of the protocol by liquidating unhealthy troves. It ensures that troves are liquidated in a timely manner, protecting the stability of the system.

**Absorber Module:**
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus/blob/main/src/core/absorber.cairo#L8
   - Mechanism: Stability pool for absorbing liquidations.
   - Review: The Absorber module provides a stability pool for absorbing liquidations and allows users to participate in the liquidation process. It enhances liquidity and stability within the protocol, safeguarding against potential disruptions.

**Equalizer Module:**
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus/blob/main/src/core/equalizer.cairo#L2
   - Mechanism: Financial controller for balancing the budget of the Shrine.
   - Review: The Equalizer module ensures the balance of the Shrine's budget by minting debt surpluses or paying down debt deficits. It helps maintain the financial health of the protocol and ensures efficient allocation of resources.

**Seer Module:**
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus/blob/main/src/core/seer.cairo#L2
   - Mechanism: Arbiter of collateral prices.
   - Review: The Seer module coordinates multiple oracle modules to determine the price of underlying collateral tokens. It enhances transparency and reliability by aggregating prices from multiple sources.

**Flash Mint Module:**
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus/blob/main/src/core/flash_mint.cairo#L18
   - Mechanism: Implementation of EIP-3156 Flash Loans.
   - Review: The Flash Mint module enables users to borrow and repay yin tokens in the same transaction, without incurring any fees. It enhances liquidity and flexibility within the protocol, allowing users to access funds seamlessly.

**Controller Module:**
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus/blob/main/src/core/controller.cairo#L2
   - Mechanism: Autonomous interest rate governor.
   - Review: The Controller module adjusts the global interest rate multiplier for troves based on market conditions to minimize peg error. It ensures stability and equilibrium within the protocol by influencing user behavior through interest rate adjustments.

**Caretaker Module:**
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus/blob/main/src/core/caretaker.cairo#L2
    - Mechanism: Global shutdown mechanism.
    - Review: The Caretaker module orchestrates the graceful shutdown of the protocol, allowing users to claim collateral backing their yin tokens and withdraw remaining collateral from troves. It ensures a fair and transparent shutdown process, safeguarding user interests.

Opus protocol is built on a robust framework of modules that work synergistically to maintain stability, security, and efficiency. Each module serves a distinct function within the ecosystem, contributing to the overall resilience and functionality of the protocol.

# Centralization risks
**Oracle:** protocol can set the price oracle used in throughtout the system which could lead to centralisation risks.
**Protocol shutdown:** Protocol admin possess the ability to shutdown/kill the protocol
Critical-parameter adjustment

## Systemic Risks
**Oracle Failures:** Opus relies on external data sources, such as price feeds from oracles, to determine key parameters like interest rates and collateral values. If these oracles fail or provide inaccurate data due to manipulation or technical issues, it could lead to incorrect pricing and valuation within the platform, resulting in liquidations, undercollateralization, and systemic instability.

**Market Volatility:** DeFi platforms like Opus are susceptible to market volatility, which can lead to sudden and significant price swings in collateral assets. Sharp declines in collateral values could trigger liquidations and cascade effects, where forced selling exacerbates price declines, leading to further liquidations and losses for users.

**Liquidity Crunch:** If there is insufficient liquidity within Opus, it could impair the functioning of the platform and hinder users' ability to enter or exit positions. Liquidity crunches can lead to increased slippage, higher transaction costs, and a breakdown in market efficiency, exacerbating systemic risks.
